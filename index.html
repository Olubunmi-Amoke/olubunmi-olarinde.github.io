    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a machine learning enthusiast and graduate student in the Master of Data Science program at Eastern University, PA.
      I am particularly drawn to projects that sit at the intersection of data science, public health, and ethical AI. 
      I care deeply about creating systems that not only function well but are also fair, human-centered, and socially responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Career-wise, I’m drawn to applied AI roles that blend technical problem-solving with public impact: whether in research, product development, or mission-driven innovation.
      My academic background is multidisciplinary, and I bring a unique blend of analytical rigor, creative thinking, and lived insight to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of data science, I am a vocal coach and a music performer who still sneaks in harmonies during long coding sessions!
      Whether it’s teaching music theory or analyzing data, I enjoy exploring creative ways to connect technology with everyday life.
      This site showcases selected projects, including my capstone project—<em>The Smart Sickle Cell Diary App</em>—which explores symptom tracking and insight generation for Sickle Cell Disease management.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> I once ran a summer music camp with kids aged 6 to 13: equal parts chaos and pure joy!</p>
